# WaveLength

Music app. Wraps Rapid API's YT Music API and YouTube's official v3 API.

For both web (TypeScript + SvelteKit) & mobile (Dart + Flutter)
Backend code written alongside web svelte client with SvelteKit's API routes.

Neon Database, managed with Drizzle.

Didn't wanna make the same mistake like before and overcomplicate the tech stack.
